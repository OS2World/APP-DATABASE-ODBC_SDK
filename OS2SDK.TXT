Chapter 1:  Installing the ODBC SDK for OS/2--Beta

*******************************************************

The Visigenic Open Database Connectivity Software 
Development Kit (ODBC SDK) for OS/2 is a set of software 
components, tools, and documentation designed to help you 
develop ODBC drivers and ODBC-enabled applications for 
the OS/2 operating systems. This chapter describes the 
Software Development Kit (SDK) components and how to 
install them. It includes these major sections:

Installing the ODBC SDK for OS/2	


About the ODBC SDK for OS/2
============================
The ODBC interface makes it possible for applications to 
access data from a variety of database management systems 
(DBMS's). The ODBC interface permits maximum 
interoperability--an application can access data in diverse 
DBMS's through a single interface. Furthermore, that 
application is independent of any DBMS from which it 
accesses data. Users of the application can add software 
components called drivers, which interface between an 
application and a specific DBMS.

The ODBC SDK contains setup, installation, administration, 
and ODBC program files. In addition, a set of libraries, 
include files, help files, utilities, drivers, and sample 
programs are included. For a complete list of the product 
components and their filenames, see the file 
PACKLIST.TXT, which the ODBC SDK Setup program 
copies to your \ODBC directory.


Samples Programs and the Setup Toolkit Utility
===============================================
The ODBC SDK includes several sample programs and a 
Driver Setup Toolkit utility. 

Sample Programs

The ODBC SDK Install program copies the source code files 
and makefiles for the following sample programs:

o  Quick Test (QUIKTEST)
o  Sample Application (PROGREF)
o  Sample Driver (SMPLDRVR)

The program copies these files into subdirectories of the 
\ODBC\SAMPLES directory. Executable sample files are 
copied to the \ODBC\BIN directory. 

Quick Test (QUIKTEST)
=====================
You can use the Quick Test sample program (located in 
\ODBC\SAMPLES\QUIKTEST\QUIKTEST.C) as a starting 
point for writing and executing your own auto tests that test 
the functionality of your ODBC driver. An auto test contains 
one or more test cases, each of which tests a specific function 
of the driver. The Quick Test program calls each ODBC 
function and verifies that it returns the expected code.

Sample Application (PROGREF)
============================
You can use the sample application (located in 
\ODBC\SAMPLES\PROGREF\PROGREF.C) to test your 
ODBC-compliant drivers. The sample application makes all 
the Core, Level 1, and Level 2 API calls to the Driver 
Manager. The required include files and makefile are also 
provided. 

Sample Driver (SMPLDVR)
=======================
The sample driver (located in 
\ODBC\SAMPLES\SMPLDRVR\SMPLDRVR.C) shows you 
how to write an ODBC driver. This C-language template 
includes a source code template to help you write a driver-
specific setup DLL that will work with both the ODBC 
Administrator and the Driver Setup Toolkit utility.

Driver Setup Toolkit Utility
============================
The Driver Setup Toolkit provides you with an easy way to 
include a customized setup program with your ODBC drivers. 
The toolkit is located in \ODBC\DRVSETUP.KIT\SETUP 
and is based on the same setup program that installs the 
drivers included with the Visigenic ODBC DriverSet for 
OS/2. 

Hardware and Software Requirements
==================================
To use the ODBC SDK, you will need the following minimum 
hardware configuration:

o  A personal computer using the Intel® 80386 (386 DX or 386 SX) 
   or newer processor and a VGA or higher-resolution graphics card
o  At least 8 Mb (16 Mb recommended) of random-access memory (RAM)
o  At least one 3.5-inch (1.44-Mb) or one 5.25-inch (1.2-Mb) disk 
   drive
o  Approximately 10 Mb of hard disk space for the complete 
   installation (including samples) of the SDK (additional disk 
   space for developing ODBC drivers or applications is also required)

Before installing the SDK, make sure that the following 
software is already installed on your system or available for 
use:

o  OS/2 Warp, Version 3.0
o  OS/2 C Compiler


Installing the ODBC SDK for OS/2
=================================
The ODBC SDK Setup program (INSTALL) is a 
straightforward installation program. When Setup runs, it 
installs the ODBC Administrator program, required ODBC 
SDK files, as well as the libraries, include files, tools, API 
help files, and sample programs. 

During the installation, you are prompted for the directory 
name in which you want the ODBC SDK to reside. The 
default installation directory is \ODBC. At the end of the 
installation, a new environment variable, ODBC_PATH, is 
added to your CONFIG.SYS file and is set to reflect the path 
to your ODBC root directory.

Note:  ODBC_PATH specifies your ODBC SDK installation 
directory. The ODBC Administrator uses this path to find the 
ODBC.INI file--an initialization file used by both the ODBC 
Driver Manager and ODBC drivers.

The installation program creates (if you have not already 
installed the Visigenic ODBC DriverSet) or adds files to the 
following directories in your ODBC root directory:

Directory               Description
-----------             -----------
BIN                     Contains the ODBC Administrator program.
HELP                    Contains the ODBC SDK help files.
INCLUDE                 Contains the ODBC include files.
LIB                     Contains the Driver Manager libraries.
DLL                     Contains the SDK dynamic link libraries.
DRVSETUP.KIT            Contains the Driver Setup Toolkit utility files.
SAMPLES                 Contains the sample program directories and files.
REDIST                  Contains the redistributable SDK files.
DRIVERS                 Contains the driver files.

Once the ODBC program group and ODBC Administrator are 
installed, Setup invokes the ODBC Administrator. You use 
the ODBC Administrator to add and configure data sources 
for your installed ODBC drivers.

Note:  If you have already installed the DB2 driver, you must copy 
the ODBC.INI and ODBCINST.INI files from your DB2 root 
directory to the ODBC root directory specified by 
ODBCPATH before you install the ODBC SDK for OS/2.

To install the ODBC SDK
=======================
1.  Insert the diskette labeled "ODBC SDK for OS/2" in 
    your diskette drive.

2.  Open an OS/2 Window.	

3.  In the OS/2 Window, type the letter of the driver that 
    contains the diskette, followed by a colon, and the 
    word install.

    For example if the A: drive contains the diskette, type the 
    following:
      A:INSTALL

    Follow the instructions displayed in the Setup 
    program's dialog boxes.

4.  Make the appropriate changes to the CONFIG.SYS file.

    After it has copied all the ODBC SDK files to your 
    system, Setup asks you whether you want to update 
    the CONFIG.SYS file.

    Click Yes if you want the ODBC installation program 
    to prepend the ODBC installation path to your PATH 
    environment variable and add the ODBC_PATH 
    environment variable to your CONFIG.SYS file.

    Click No if you want to manually add those changes to 
    the CONFIG.SYS file.

    The setup process is now complete.

Chapter 2: Managing Data Sources and Drivers--Beta

**************************************************************



This chapter explains how to use the ODBC Administrator to 
add database drivers and data sources. The ODBC SDK 
Setup program invokes the ODBC Administrator after it has 
finished copying the essential SDK program files.

About Drivers and Data Sources	

Invoking the ODBC Administrator	

Managing Data Sources	

Managing Drivers	


About Drivers and Data Sources
==============================
Drivers are the components that process ODBC requests and 
return data to the application. If necessary, drivers modify an 
application's request into a form that is understood by the 
data source. You use the ODBC Administrator to add and 
delete drivers from your system.

Data sources are the databases or files accessed by a driver. 
For the drivers shipped with the ODBC SDK, a set of data 
sources is created upon installation. You use the ODBC 
Administrator to add, configure, and delete data sources from 
your system.


Invoking the ODBC Administrator
===============================
You can open the ODBC Administrator by clicking on the 
ODBC program group or by typing ODBCADM in an OS/2 
window.2

To open the ODBC Administrator from the ODBC program 
group

1.  Open the ODBC program group in the Program 
    Manager.

2.  Double-click the ODBC icon in the ODBC program 
    group. 

    The ODBC Administrator will run.

    Once the ODBC Administrator is running, the Data 
    Sources dialog box appears. 


Managing Data Sources
=====================
After installing an ODBC driver, you can define one or more 
data sources for it. The data source name should provide a 
unique description of the data; for example, Payroll or 
Accounts Payable. The data sources that are defined for all 
the currently installed drivers are listed in the Data Sources 
(Driver) list box in the Data Sources dialog box.

A data source associates a particular ODBC driver with the 
data you want to access through that driver. For example, you 
might create a data source to use the ODBC Oracle7 driver to 
access one or more Oracle7 databases found in a specific 
directory on your hard disk or a network drive. With the 
ODBC Administrator, you can add, delete, and configure the 
data sources you require.

Note:  To add data sources, you must first be able to access an 
ODBC driver. This means that the ODBC driver must be 
installed before you can add and modify data sources for that 
driver.


Adding Data Sources
===================
You can add multiple data sources, each one associating a 
driver with some data you want to access using that driver. 
You need to give each data source a name that uniquely 
identifies that data source. For example, if you create a data 
source for an Informix database that contains customer 
information, you might name the data source "Customers." 
Applications typically display data source names for users to 
choose from.

To add a data source
--------------------
1.  Invoke the ODBC Administrator. 

2.  Choose the Add button. 

    The Add Data Source dialog box appears.

    The Installed ODBC Drivers list box displays the names 
    of installed drivers. If the data source you want to add 
    requires a driver that has not been installed, you will have 
    to install the driver first. 

3.  From the Installed ODBC Drivers list, select the driver 
    for the data source to use.

4.  Click OK.

    A driver-specific Setup dialog boxin this example, the 
    Setup dialog box for the Oracle driverfor the data 
    source appears.

    Since each driver is different, each data source requires a 
    slightly different configuration. Because of this, each data 
    source has a unique Setup dialog box. For detailed 
    information on the options in a data source Setup dialog 
    box, choose the Help button in the dialog box.

5.  Enter the required information about the data source, 
    such as the data source name and user names.

6.  When you have finished configuring the data source, 
    click OK. 

    The driver-specific Setup dialog box disappears.

7.  To add more data sources, repeat steps 2 through 6.

8.  Click Close to close the ODBC Administrator.


To modify a data source
-----------------------
1.  Invoke the ODBC Administrator.

    The Data Sources dialog box appears.

2.  In the Data Sources dialog box, select the data source 
    you want to modify--in this example, the Employees 
    data source--and then click the Setup button.

    The Visigenic ODBC Oracle Setup dialog box appears. 

    Since each driver is different, each data source requires a 
    slightly different configuration. Because of this, each data 
    source has a unique Setup dialog box. For detailed 
    information on the options in a data source Setup dialog 
    box, choose the Help button in the dialog box.

3.  Modify the applicable data source fields, and then click 
    OK. 

    The driver-specific Setup dialog box disappears.

4.  To modify more data sources, repeat steps 2 through 3.

5.  Click Close to close the ODBC Administrator.

To delete data sources
----------------------
Select the name of the data source you want to delete from the Data 
Source dialog box and click Delete.

A message box appears allowing you to confirm that you 
want to delete the data source:

o  Choose the Yes button to delete the data source.

o  Choose the No button to return to the Data Sources 
   dialog box without deleting the data source.


Setting Tracing Options
-----------------------
The ODBC Options dialog box--that you access through the 
Data Sources dialog box--allows you to configure the way 
ODBC function calls are traced. 

How Tracing Works
-----------------
When you activate tracing from the ODBC Options dialog 
box, the Driver Manager will log all ODBC function calls for 
all subsequently run applications. ODBC function calls from 
applications running before tracing is activated are not 
logged. Logging is done by writing all ODBC function calls to 
a log file you specify.

By default, tracing will stop as soon as any application being 
traced closes. You can choose to have tracing continue after 
an ODBC application closes. However, keep in mind that 
while tracing is on, the log file will continue to increase in 
size, and that the performance of your ODBC applications 
will be affected.

To enable and disable tracing
-----------------------------
1.  Invoke the ODBC Administrator.

2.  Click the Options button. 

    The ODBC Options dialog box appears. 

3.  Check the Trace ODBC Calls box. 

    The Stop Tracing Automatically box is activated.

4.  To disable the automatic stopping of ODBC call 
    tracing, clear the Stop Tracing Automatically box. 

    Otherwise, the tracing of ODBC calls stops when the first 
    application that uses tracing is terminated.

    Note:  If you disable automatic stopping of ODBC call tracing, 
    the log file will continue to increase in size, and the 
    performance of your ODBC applications will be affected.

    When you clear the Stop Tracing Automatically box, the 
    Driver Manager prompts you with a message box for 
    confirmation. Click OK to confirm or Cancel to leave the 
    Stop Tracing Automatically box selected.
   
5.  Click the Select File... Button.

    Type the name of the log file to which you want the Driver 
    Manager to write the ODBC calls. Or use the drive and 
    directory boxes to choose an existing log file to which to 
    append new information.

6.  Click OK. 

    The ODBC Options dialog box closes. Any ODBC 
    applications that you run after you close the Data Sources 
    dialog box will have all ODBC function calls appended to 
    the file you selected.

7.  Click Close to close the Data Source dialog box.



Managing Drivers
================
To configure data sources, you must have at least the ODBC 
driver for that data source installed on your system--like a 
driver from the Visigenic ODBC DriverSet for OS/2.

To view installed drivers and driver information
------------------------------------------------
1.  Invoke the ODBC Administrator. 

2.  Click the Drivers button. 

    The Drivers dialog box appears.

    The Installed ODBC Drivers list box displays the drivers 
    installed on your system.

    Note:On OS/2, the Drivers dialog box does not have Add or 
    Delete buttons. You add drivers through the driver's 
    installation program.

3.  Click the About button. 

    The About dialog box appears.

    This dialog box displays file and version information for 
    the selected driver.

4.   Click OK.

     The About dialog box disappears.

5.   Repeat steps 2 through 4 until you have finished 
     examining installed driver information.

6.   Click Close to close the ODBC Administrator.

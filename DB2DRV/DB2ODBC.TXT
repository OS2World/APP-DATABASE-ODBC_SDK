This contains instructions for registering the DB2 ODBC Driver under
the Visigenic OS/2 ODBC Driver Manager. You must first have installed
CAE/2, which is the OS/2 client that comes with DB2/2 V2.1. Also, you
must have installed the ODBC SDK for OS/2 from Visigenic Software.

Next,
1. Rename/Backup the following files currently in the %DB2PATH%
   directory where you installed CAE/2 (the following assumes
   SQLLIB is the DB2 CAE/2 install directory):
   a. DB2ODBC.EXE in SQLLIB\BIN
   b. DB2ODBC.DLL in SQLLIB\DLL
   c. DB2CLI.MO and DB2CLIH.MO in SQLLIB\MSG\PRIME

2. Copy the files from the %ODBC_PATH%\DB2DRV directory in the following
   manner (again assuming that SQLLIB is your CAE/2 install directory):
   a. Copy DB2ODBC.EXE to SQLLIB\BIN
   b. Copy DB2ODBC.DLL to SQLLIB\DLL
   c. DB2CLI.MO and DB2CLIH.MO in SQLLIB\MSG\PRIME

3. Run the DB2ODBC.EXE that you just copied into SQLLIB\BIN to register
   the DB2 ODBC Driver under the Visigenic OS/2 ODBC Driver Manager. If
   this is successful, you will see the message:
   CLI0178I  The DB2 ODBC Driver has been successfully registered.

4. Now you can use the Visigenic ODBC Administrator tool (ODBCADM.EXE)
   to add your DB2 data sources.
